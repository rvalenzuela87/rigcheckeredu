## About
 
The purpose behind this tool is to offer a way for rigging students (or riggers in general) to follow a set of 
guidelines for their projects. These guidelines can be set by a studio or a rigging course instructor.

The project's guidelines are stored in a json file which can be edited via its own window. They can include how 
the controls should be named, weather to use a specific suffix, where they should be stored, etc. It supports 
guidelines regarding naming convention and hierarchy.

By using this tool the rigging student can make sure the rig's parts, i.e. its controls, geometry and different
hierarchy groups, are discoverable when following the project's guidelines.

By now, this tool remains a work in progress.

## Instalation
To run the tool just drag-n-drop the file *install.mel* present in the root directory. Or, execute the file
*install.py*, also present in the root directory, in a python tab in the script editor.
